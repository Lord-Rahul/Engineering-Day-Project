        <h1 id="why">Why Engineering day celebrated</h1>
        <p class="tr">Engineers’ Day, observed on September 15th each year in India, is a day dedicated to celebrating the remarkable contributions of engineers to society. It is also an opportunity to remember the visionary engineer, Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, whose birth anniversary coincides with this special day. In this article, we will explore the history, significance, and the reason why Engineers’ Day is celebrated on September 15th.

            The Origin of Engineers’ Day
            Born in 1861, Visvesvaraya initially pursued a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at the University of Mysore. However, he later transitioned to engineering studies at the prestigious College of Science in Pune, one of Asia’s oldest engineering institutions. Beginning his career in the Public Works Department for the Government of Bombay, Visvesvaraya undertook complex projects, including the development of a patented irrigation system featuring water floodgates at the Khadakvasla reservoir near Pune and the construction of the Krishna Raja Sagara Dam in Mysore.
            
            In 1912, he assumed the role of the 19th Diwan of Mysore, a position he held until 1918. Throughout his life, Visvesvaraya received numerous accolades, including India’s highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna. His significant contributions also extended to the establishment of the Government Engineering College in Bangalore in 1917, which was later renamed in his honor.
            
            In recognition of his exceptional achievements in civil engineering, the Indian government, in 1968, designated his birth anniversary, September 15th, as National Engineer’s Day, a day dedicated to commemorating and celebrating the contributions of engineers to society.</p>
